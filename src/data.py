    Uses a left join (not inner): train_identity.csv covers only ~24% of
    TransactionIDs, so an inner join would silently discard the other ~76%
    of rows. Identity columns are NaN for transactions with no identity
    record.

        path: Directory containing train_transaction.csv and
            train_identity.csv (e.g. the data/ directory produced by
            scripts/download_data.sh).
        nrows: If given, only read this many rows from train_transaction.csv.
            Useful for fast local iteration; leave as None for the full file.
